**Is your function or algorithm new to our collection.**

Please check the list of already available functions and suggest improvements:
- https://github.com/axkr/symja_android_library/blob/master/symja_android_library/doc/99-function-reference.md

**Describe the solution you would like to provide**

- what should the new function signature look like?

- is your function or algorithm implemented in an open source library?

- how can a converter from and to the libraries used internal format be created?

If necessary discuss the new function in the [Gitter chat group][1].
